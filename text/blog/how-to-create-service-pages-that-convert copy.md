Your service pages are one of the most important aspects of your website. Not only are they there to tell a website visitor what you can do, but they should also do a great job of convincing potential customers to spend money with you.

So, in this article, we’re going to outline how you can create service pages that convert. Let’s get started.

## 1. Ensure Your Service Page Copy Targets The Best Keywords

Targeting the right keywords on all of your website’s pages is vital for boosting your SEO and helping you to reach the most relevant people. You especially want to put plenty of time and energy into choosing the right keywords for your service pages, because you only want to attract traffic from people who might actually be interested in spending money with you.

Start by heading to a <A href="https://loganix.com/keyword-research/">keyword research</A> tool like <A href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google Keyword Planner</A> with a list of words and phrases related to the service you’re planning to write about. Plug them into the planner and Google will provide you with a list of keywords based on their competitiveness, or how hard they are to rank for, and their average monthly search volumes. Be sure to try to find a balance between both volume and competition — you want your chosen keywords to have enough search volume to make your efforts worth it, but not so competitive that you won’t stand a chance of ranking.

You’ll then want to select keywords that are very relevant to the service page you’re writing for. Start thinking like a customer — if you were looking for the services on your website, what would you be typing into Google? Targeting these types of phrases can help keep your keywords relevant.

Lastly, be sure to always consider search intent. There are generally three types of queries:

- Informational: Searches where people are trying to learn about a topic; typically “how” or “why” questions
- Navigational: Searches where people are looking for a specific website
- Transactional: Searches where people are looking to take a specific action, like purchase a product. These often contain words like “buy” or “cheap”

You want to be confident that, when a searcher comes across your website, they’ll find the information, products, or services they’re looking for, and considering the intent behind the keywords you use will help to ensure this. If you don’t consider intent, you run the risk of people coming to your website and feeling frustrated because they don’t find what they need. This will be bad for your business and overall SEO.

Once you’ve chosen the most appropriate keywords for your service pages, weaving them through the copy, titles, and headers can help improve your rankings on the most relevant search engine results pages (SERPs). Just be sure to incorporate them into your copy naturally. Your website visitors shouldn’t be able to notice that your copy includes strategically placed keywords at all.

## 2. Use The Power Of Strong Call To Action

A call to action, or CTA, is very important for ensuring conversions on your service pages. CTAs are words or phrases, often on a button, that tell the user what to do next. Sometimes, people just need a little extra push in order to figure out what to do next.

Here are a few tips for creating strong CTAs:

- Use a strong action verb
- Tap into a viewer’s sense of FOMO
- Use contrasting colors for your CTA button
- Use your brand voice to add personality

Let’s take a look at a few examples of strong CTAs for inspiration.

<Mockup src="/blog/looka.png" alt="looka"/>

Looka, a company that specializes in helping other businesses to design their branding, has a great CTA on their <A href="https://looka.com/logo-maker/">logo maker</A> service page.

As you can see in the image above, there is a clear CTA on a bright purple button, which reads “Let’s make a logo!”. This CTA will encourage website visitors to get excited about their Looka design journey and can push them to get started.

On your website, try to engage your website visitors in a similar way. Doing so can help increase your conversion rate.

<Mockup src="/blog/hootsuite.png" alt="hootsuite"/>

Hootsuite, a <A href="https://www.hootsuite.com/platform/publish">social media management platform</A>, has a quality CTA on their service page, as well.

As you can see, the supporting copy notes that their program can save you time and the CTA itself highlights their free trial offer. Offering a free trial is an enticing way to encourage website visitors to convert!

On your own site, consider highlighting discounts or trials in your CTAs to improve your conversion rate. It can make a huge difference.

## 3. Always Make Space For Testimonials From Happy Clients

People tend to value word-of-mouth recommendations over other types of marketing so, by highlighting positive customer reviews on your service pages, you can build trust between website visitors and your business, potentially leading to more conversions.

For your service pages, you’ll usually benefit the most from quotes and longer testimonials that allow your past clients to go into detail about their experiences of working with your business. Let’s take a look at a few businesses that implement this strategy well for inspiration.

<Mockup src="/blog/hclinical.png" alt="hclinical"/>

H Clinical, a company that specializes in clinical trial services, highlights client testimonials on their service page for <A href="https://hclinical.com/project-management/">clinical trial project management</A>.

One of their testimonials, seen in the image above, highlights H Clinical’s quick service and expertise. This reassures the website visitor that the company’s team is experts in their field, thus leading to more conversions.

On your website, highlight testimonials that showcase your expertise. This will build trust with your customers and help earn you more sales.

<Mockup src="/blog/testimonial.png" alt="testimonial"/>

Backlinko, a digital marketing company, does something similar on their service page for their <A href="https://backlinko.com/seo-training">SEO training</A>.

At the bottom of the page, they highlight some of the best testimonials from their 4,000+ graduates! They include quotes, videos, and more.

On your website, consider incorporating video testimonials into your service pages. It can show how authentic your client reviews are and encourage website visitors to convert.

## 4. Make Sure Taking The Next Step Is Very Easy

When people land on your service page, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to take the next step. This will increase your chances of making a sale! You can make it easy for people to find more information or move forward in the buying journey by offering clear CTAs, providing a sophisticated search feature, or making it easy for them to get in touch with you or your customer service team.

Let’s take a look at a few examples of businesses that implement this strategy well for inspiration.

<Mockup src="/blog/freshbooks.png" alt="freshbooks"/>

FreshBooks, an online accounting service provider, makes it easy for website visitors to take the next step on their <A href="https://www.freshbooks.com/accounting-software/for-small-business">small business accounting service</A> page. As you can see, visitors simply plug in their information and will then receive a free trial!

It’s very clear what a visitor needs to do to take the next step, which is sure to be helpful in securing more conversions for the company.

On your website’s service pages, consider implementing a similar form if appropriate. It can help get customers excited about your services, allow them to sign up quickly and easily, and improve your conversion rate.

<Mockup src="/blog/icash.png" alt="icash"/>

<A href="https://icash.ca/online-payday-loans">iCASH</A>, a financial services provider, makes it easy for customers to take the next step on their online loan service page.

As you can see in the image above, a user can simply plug in the amount of money they need, how many repayments they wish to make, and their place of residence. iCASH then personalizes a loan deal just for that particular user. Because of the personalization and ease of use, this type of feature can be great for increasing the company’s conversion rate.

On your website, consider how you could create a tool that personalizes your services so they suit each website visitor. Doing something like this will help make it easier for a user to take the next step, thus improving your conversion rate.  

## 5. Provide several Contact Options And Make Them Easy To Find

If prospective customers have a question or concern, they’ll want to get in touch with you. If they have a hard time doing this, they might leave without making a purchase. So, be sure to provide several contact options, like email, phone, live messaging, or social media direct messaging. This will help ensure that different types of people can contact you through their preferred channels.

If your contact options are easy to find, people will be more likely to get in touch with you, thus improving the likelihood of them converting. Let’s take a look at an example of a website that has successfully implemented different customer service contact options on its service page for inspiration.

<Mockup src="/blog/Osmon.png" alt="Osmon"/>

OSMON Moving & Storage, a moving group based out of California, provides a variety of contact options on their page for <A href="https://osmonmoving.com/long-distance-moving/">long-distance moving services</A>.

As you can see in the image above, there is a form for website visitors to fill in their information to get a quote. Additionally, there is a phone number at the top of the page if they would prefer to talk to someone. This gives website visitors several different ways to get in touch so, if they have a concern or problem, they can easily solve it! This will help increase their likelihood of converting.

<Mockup src="/blog/spectrum.png" alt="spectrum"/>

Spectrum, an internet, TV, and phone service provider offer great customer service on their <A href="https://www.spectrum.net/support/category/internet">internet</A>  support page. As you can see in the image above, Spectrum provides several different articles that a customer can read first in order to see if they have the solution to their problem. They also have phone call customer support and live chat service. Using this live chat service, a customer can quickly outline the problem they’re facing and get their internet rebooted on the spot without having to mess with their equipment. This is a very smart and helpful approach for Spectrum to take — not everyone is tech-savvy and will get enough help from an article or over the phone. Because the live chat service quickly and easily solves the problem for them, it proves effective and helps to ensure that the customer will renew their subscription year after year.

On your website, it’s a good idea to take a similar approach. Consider posting your phone number at the top of each service page to show your website visitors that they can call to get the answer to any questions.  You can provide some additional communication options, too — you might find that some of your customers prefer a live chat service, while others prefer to talk to someone by email. By having multiple options, you’ll make it easier for people to take the next step with your business.

## 6. Choose Your Service Page Imagery Carefully

Strong visuals are very important for grabbing people’s attention and showing them what your business is all about. You can use imagery to put a face to your business, show people what it’s like to work with you or showcase your brand’s personality.

The right imagery can also help you make more sales! Generally speaking, it’s best to create your own original imagery but, if you’re in a pinch, stock images will work as well.

Let’s take a look at some websites that have excellent imagery on their service pages for inspiration.

<Mockup src="/blog/guardian.png" alt="guardian"/>

For instance, Guardian Home Care, a healthcare service company based out of Toronto, Canada, uses excellent imagery on their <A href="https://guardianhomecaretoronto.com/elder-care/">elder care services</A> page.

On this page, there is an image of a nurse smiling while taking care of an elderly patient. Think about how important this type of imagery is for a healthcare provider — people want to know that themselves or their loved ones will be properly taken care of by the company they’re planning to hire for support. By including cheerful and reassuring imagery, Guardian Home Care builds trust with their customers and encourages website visitors to convert.

On your website, think about what types of images you could implement to show your business in the most positive light possible. This will help increase your conversions.

<Mockup src="/blog/valvoline.png" alt="valvoline" height="480"/>

Valvoline, a provider of automotive services, also uses excellent imagery on their <A href="https://www.valvoline.com/recommended-auto-services">recommended auto services</A> page.

On your website, consider showing off your services in action to build trust with your website visitors; it’s a strategy that can raise your conversion rate.
