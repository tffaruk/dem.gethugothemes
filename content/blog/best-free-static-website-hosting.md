In this article, we will present a selection of professional free static website
hosting services for a project of any size and scope.

<A href="https://themefisher.com/best-static-site-generators/">Static website generators</A> are on the rise as tools to create your site. With open-source developed generators like Hugo, Gatsby, or Jekyll it is made easy for everyone to create websites without much knowledge of the underlying technologies. Large support communities and ongoing development help to implement features into your website that were hard to maintain "in the old times" when sites were made in text editors.

Having created your static website your next step is to find a way to host it and make it accessible to your audience. We try to help you decide by listing the best 10 free static website hosting services.

We focus on services that allow you to host your website using their free service tiers. We check if you can add your own custom domain and of course if modern technologies and features like HTTP/2 and SSL encryption are supported.

## What is a static website?

<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">Static websites</A> concentrate on performance and declutter complex build processes. They do not rely on databases and scripting languages but consist of a simple set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to produce speedy and modern pages.

The concept of a static website is nothing new though. Many developers even call it "the old way" of building websites. In recent years websites became more and more complex with pages being delivered to the browser after creating them from templates and content that is stored in a database using server-side scripting languages like PHP and ASP. WordPress for instance operates with PHP and a MySQL database. Even further complex sites then apply minification to make the pages use less bandwidth, as broadband connectivity is still not 100% available all over the globe.

This leads to a complex process to build a website with many moving parts that need to be understood by the developer and maintained throughout the lifetime of the website. A static website goes back to a much simpler process. The full website is pre-compiled, saved, and delivered as is and the only program required to deliver this is a modern web server.

Read on to learn more about the advantages of professional static website hosting.

## Benefits of using static website

### Affordability

Static websites contain mainly HTML, JS, and CSS files and don't require databases or server-side scripting languages to be served to the browser. This makes it very inexpensive to host, even free on the services we will check out later in this article.

### Security

With no database or server-side scripting language to exploit, no ground for unauthorized access, and no third-party extensions to monitor for vulnerabilities that allow your system to be compromised, static websites offer much more security than a dynamic website.

### Scalability

Scaling a static website is much simpler to maintain, while the overall application is more stable and does not depend on many moving parts. The server can handle more traffic to the website due to the reduced load associated with static files (as opposed to loading a template file, then loading database content, then running both through a scripting language compiler, etc.). Hosting your website on edge networks (CDNs with servers maintained worldwide) even shortens the time a page needs to load.

### Speed

With all the mentioned benefits combined, the time from requesting a page to the delivery to the browser is very short and your visitors can enjoy a blazing-fast performance. By caching the files locally you can even increase that speed. As one of the main factors for a better ranking in search engines, this will give your website a huge advantage.

The speed of your site does not only lead to a much better user experience, but it also helps with the ranking of your site. Google appreciates a fast website.

We will show how many websites you can host for free, what storage and bandwidth are offered if SSL certificates to deliver your site via safe HTTPS and custom domains are offered, and how many build minutes, if offered as a service, are included.
