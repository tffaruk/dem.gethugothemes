We've compiled a list of 10 popular CMS platforms, along with their key features, benefits, lackings, and cost.

If you are new to CMS, you can learn the fundamentals of CMS before proceeding further. But if you are already familiar with CMS, you can skip this section and directly move onto our list of the best CMS for Hugo.

## Definition of CMS

A content management system (CMS) is an application that enables people to create, maintain, and modify website content without any specialized technical knowledge.

In simple terms,  a content management system (CMS) is a technology that assists you in crafting your site without writing codes from the beginning or even without any knowledge of coding at all.

Rather than designing your personalized mechanism for crafting the web pages, saving images into the platform, and other features, CMS takes care of all the processes in one space. In the meantime, you can concentrate on other essential aspects of your website. Additionally, you can leverage the content management system for various purposes, such as

- Enabling multiple users to utilize the system simultaneously
- Managing all the documents on your site
- Maintain a content publishing cycle
- Structuring the contents of your site

So, what is headless CMS? Why is it called headless? Let’s look into it.

## About Headless CMS

A headless content management system is the current alternative to the previous monolithic CMSs that regulated content management. This trending content management solution is named "headless" since it splits the content creation and storage section or is backed from the content representation layer or the frontend (head), where content is organized for delivery. This is usually not achievable when using a standard CMS to develop a website.

While using a Headless CMS, the content and marketing team can craft and save content resources by leveraging flexible, reusable modules in a back-end repository to craft and save content material.

On the other hand, front-end designers and developers can concentrate on making the greatest possible presentation of that content. The contents may be delivered to a website, mobile app, or other online services.

Traditional content management systems are bound by coding and programming languages, but developers can control the content format delivered to the users in headless CMS.

With headless CMS, you can take the following actions:

- Create content
- Authorize users
- Maintain Content Repositories
- Advanced asset management

Now that you’ve learned about CMS and headless CMS, you should know how to select the best one for your Hugo project. For that reason, you need to set some major criteria and then match those criteria with the CMS you will choose.

## Things To Consider While Choosing The Best CMS for Hugo

Currently, the Hugo platform has over 100k active sites and is strongly supported by the Jamstack community. It has an admirable reputation for massive speed, simplicity, and versatility.  It claims to be the world's quickest static site generator that takes less than one millisecond to construct a web page.

Hugo's pre-built features such as menus, sitemaps, i18n support, shortcodes, and image optimization will assist you in running your website with ease. Also, the platform includes a vast amount of themes in its domain.

When looking for the finest CMS for the Hugo platform, you should have a list of criteria in mind. These criteria are not complex to understand, but it will become easier for you to select the best CMS for Hugo if you can sort out these key factors.

You may consider the following factors to choosing the ideal content management system:

#### **Content Administration**

Content administration or user accessibility comes first when thinking about an environment where everyone can collaborate. This is because a dedicated team of developers, content managers, and authors can maintain content in the best possible manner.

Site owners should be able to grant just editorial access to their preferred users, allowing them to update but not delete their content. Thus, you should consider a headless CMS that allows flexible user accessibility.

#### **Multi-purpose Functionality**

Think how much time and effort you can preserve for other tasks if you can maintain beyond contents. Select a Hugo CMS that can manage your websites' content and other elements or settings, such as Menu, Configuration, Image file type, etc.

#### **Multilingual Support**

Multilingual features are essential for expanding your website to a global audience. Therefore, choose a Hugo CMS that offers multilingual support.

#### **Live Preview Support**

Your headless CMS for Hugo should provide you a Live Preview of your website without launching it for public view. With a live preview, you will have a clear idea of whether you need to fix your content before publishing or not. You'll also be able to see how your content looks on various devices and determine if it's reader-friendly or not.

#### **Archetype Page Template**

The best Hugo CMS must offer arch-type page templates. With page templates, you will be able to display your preferred content elements on your selected web page.

With all these considerations in mind, you can now sort out the best CMS for you. All you need to do is sort out the specific features. Now we will walk you through our list of some of the best and most popular CMS for Hugo.
