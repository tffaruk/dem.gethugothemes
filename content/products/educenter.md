Educenter is a stylish and contemporary Hugo education theme, that has been perfectly crafted for education centers of all kinds. Designed with your School, College, University, or Training Center in mind, this ultimate education theme includes everything you need to show off your courses, teachers, and events with a clean and modern layout that makes it easy for your users to navigate through your educational content.

Fully responsive and mobile-friendly (based on the Bootstrap 4 framework), Educenter ensures that your school or college website, virtual education center or LMS is always on hand and available. Your users, students, teachers, instructors, course leaders, and admins can check-in on the latest news and keep up with the available program. It's easy to link the site to your registration or course system.

The included example site hands you a good overview of what is possible with this theme. Custom post types help you to create informative overviews of your courses and events, research topics, scholarship information packages and present your teachers and scholars with their contact and course information.

This all is rounded up by state of the art "under the hood" optimizations for a speedy website. Your visitors will be impressed with how fast your pages load and search engines will reward it.

A weblog section with all required features like comments, categories, tags, and delightful formatted overviews completes Educenter to make it the information hub for your prospective students.
